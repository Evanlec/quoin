Description
-----------
Coding exercise modeling a real world city transportation system

Requirements
------------
A metropolitan transportation authority is putting in a system for commuter passes.

* The city has several modes of transport: bus, subway, commuter rail, and a special bus used only by the elderly.
* A vending machine distributes the passes.
* The passes may be bought for monthly unlimited use or money can be placed on the pass and the traveller will be charged per ride.
* Each mode of transport charges a different base amount per ride. The same goes for the monthly passes: each mode of transport has a different base monthly price.
* Students and the elderly get a 50% percent discount for both the individual rides and for the monthly pass.
* In the future, the base prices and the discounts for either students or the elderly (or both) may change.
* The cost of the monthly pass is pro-rated: after the 15th of the month, the price is halved.
* Weekend individual ride prices are 75% of the weekday base prices.
* Transportation workers will be issued a special pass that lets them get on any mode of transport for free.
* In the future, the system will need to support different prices for single rides on trains and subway based on length of trip.
* A user must be able to buy a pass, swipe the card to board a vehicle or enter a station, or check the balance on the card.
